# KEGG-database
This is repository consists of two parts:
* Codes to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic networks automatically from KEGG database ("multi" and "database" folder)
* Codes to conduct Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) on an established E.coli model i*ML*1515, and calculate the Louvain modularity for the resulting bipartite directed weighted network ("fba and modularity" folder).
